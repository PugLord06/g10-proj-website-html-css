<h1>What is a Server?</h1>
<p>A server may be a computer code or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests remodeled a network. The device that creates the request, and receives a response from the server, is named a consumer. On the net, the term "server" usually refers to the pc system that receives requests for an online files and sends those files to the consumer.</p>

<h2>What is a server used for?</h2>
<p>Servers manage network resources. as an example, a user could found out a server to regulate access to a network, send/receive e-mail, manage print jobs, or host an internet site. they're additionally good at playing intense calculations. Some servers square measure committed to a particular task, usually mentioned as dedicated. However, several servers these days square measure shared servers that fight the responsibility of e-mail, DNS, FTP, and even multiple websites within the case of an internet server.

<h2>Why are Servers meant to be on at all times?</h2>
<p>They are normally accustomed deliver services that are perpetually needed, most servers ar never turned off. Consequently, once servers fail, they will cause the network users and company several issues. To alleviate these problems, servers ar normally discovered to be fault tolerant.</p>

<h2>Examples of some servers</h2>
<p>The following list contains links to various server types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Application server</li>
<li>Blade server</li>
<li>Cloud server</li>
<li>Database server</li>
<li>Dedicated server</li>
<li>Domain name service</li>
<li>File server</li>
<li>Mail server</li>
<li>Print server</li>
<li>Proxy server</li>
<li>Standalone server</li>
<li>Web server</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do other computers connect to a server?</h2>
<p>With an area network, the server connects to a router or switch that every one different computers on the network use. Once connected to the network, different computers will access that server and its options. as an example, with an online server, a user might connect with the server to look at a web site, search, and communicate with different users on the network.</p>

An Internet server works an equivalent approach as an area network server, however on a way larger scale. The server is appointed AN information processing address by InterNIC, or by internet host.</p>

<p>Usually, users connect with a server exploitation its name, that is registered with a site name registrar. once users connect with the name (such as "computerhope.com"), the name is mechanically translated to the server's information processing address by a DNS resolver.</p>

<p>The name makes it easier for users to attach to the server, as a result of the name is less complicated to recollect than AN information processing address. Also, domain names change the server operator to vary the information processing address of the server while not disrupting the approach that users access the server. The name will continuously stay an equivalent, although the information processing address changes.</p>
